{"decision":"hold", "reason":"The market shows a downward trend with significant resistance at $145,000 and support at $144,000. Despite recent positive sentiment from ETF inflows, the technical analysis indicates overbought conditions and a bearish engulfing pattern, suggesting a price drop is likely. Given the commission costs and current market volatility, the recommendation is to hold until a clearer buying signal emerges at or near the $144,000 support level."}
